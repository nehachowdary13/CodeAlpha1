Overview
Welcome to the Hangman Game! This simple Python game challenges you to guess a randomly selected word by guessing individual letters. You have a limited number of incorrect guesses to identify the word before you lose.

Features
Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
Allows you to guess letters one at a time.
Tracks incorrect guesses and provides feedback on the number of remaining chances.
Displays the current state of the word with correctly guessed letters revealed and placeholders for remaining letters.
Ends the game when the word is correctly guessed or when the number of incorrect guesses exceeds the allowed limit.
How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

Copy the code into a Python file, for example, hangman.py.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing hangman.py.

Run the script using the command:

bash
Copy code
python hangman.py
Follow the prompts to guess letters and try to complete the word before running out of chances.

Code Explanation
Imports: The random module is used to select a random word from a predefined list.
Word Selection: A word is randomly chosen from the list of words.
Game Initialization: Initializes the guessed letters with underscores and sets the maximum number of incorrect guesses.
Game Loop: Repeatedly prompts the user for a letter guess, updates the guessed letters or incorrect guesses, and checks for win/loss conditions.
End Conditions: The game ends when either the word is completely guessed or the maximum number of incorrect guesses is reached.
Customization
You can customize the list of words by modifying the words list in the script. Adjust the number of allowed incorrect guesses by changing the max_incorrect_guesses variable.
